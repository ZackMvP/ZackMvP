Hello, I'm Zack. A learner and beginner on github as well as the computer science study.  
I mainly use github to upload my few boredom projects/code.  
I'm intrested on cybersecurity, networking, linux, and more.  
I'm not really interested in collaborating, but feel free to ask.  
I can speak both english and indonesia, with the ladder being natural.
